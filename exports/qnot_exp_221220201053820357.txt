react :: +js library for ui
things are done through events not declarative
component based, breaking code into small components - encapsulation
can manage state inside application

// useref 
refs persist between renders of component BUT doesn't cause rerender when updated
useref returns object - has single property 'current' - current is what is persistent
example of use: count number of times comp renders - can't do with state because when state updates it will rerender causing infintite loop
